I am building a single-page dashboard UI for my PERWER project. 
Use HTML + TailwindCSS + JS . Follow these exact design requirements:

1. Layout:
   - A top header bar with the title "PERWER Dashboard" and a subtitle "Energy Monitoring & AI System".
   - Below the header, place a **Log Window** and an **AI Predictions Panel** side by side (responsive: stack vertically on small screens).
   - Below that, display a responsive grid of **Data Cards** for raw sensor values.

2. Log & AI Section:
   - Left: "Logs Window"
     - Styled like a terminal/console (dark background, monospaced font, scrollable).
     - Example entries:
       [02:41] Grid connected
       [02:42] Generator OFF
       [02:45] Battery SOC: 72%
       [02:46] Load demand: 2.4 W
   - Right: "AI Predictions"
     - Card with insights in a clean list format.
     - Example predictions:
       ðŸ”‹ Predicted Battery Depletion Time: 3.5h
       âš¡ Grid Stability: High
       ðŸŒž Solar Expected Output Next Hour: 920 W
       ðŸ“Œ Recommended Action: Switch to solar priority

3. Data Cards (grid below logs & AI):
   - Generator Card:
     - Show generator_status (ON/OFF) with a green/red indicator.
     - Show generator_uptime_h in hours.
   - Grid Card:
     - Show grid_status (ON/OFF) with indicator.
     - Show grid_uptime_h in hours.
   - Solar PV Card:
     - pv_current_a (A), pv_voltage_v (V), pv_power_w (W).
   - Battery Card:
     - battery_current_a (A), battery_voltage_v (V).
     - SOC (%) and SOH (%).
   - Load Card:
     - load_current_a (A), load_voltage_v (V), load_power_w (W).
   - Environment Card:
     - temperature_c (Â°C).

4. Styling:
   - Use Tailwind classes for spacing, rounded corners, soft shadows.
   - Each card should be consistent: icon, title, values with units.
   - Layout should look clean and modern, responsive for desktop and mobile.

5. Data source:
   - The payload object is shaped like this:
     {
       "generator_status": "OFF",
       "generator_uptime_h": 12.4,
       "grid_status": "ON",
       "grid_uptime_h": 24.5,
       "pv_current_a": 35.2,
       "pv_voltage_v": 24.8,
       "pv_power_w": 890,
       "battery_current_a": 45.2,
       "battery_voltage_v": 25.6,
       "load_current_a": 12.4,
       "load_voltage_v": 230,
       "load_power_w": 2.4,
       "temperature_c": 28,
       "SOH": 95,
       "SOC": 72
     }

6. Task:
   - Generate the full HTML code with Tailwind that implements this design.
   - Make the payload a mock state variable at the top so I can later connect it to live data.
   - Use clean component structure (e.g., Card component reused for Generator, Grid, etc.).
   - Ensure the Logs and AI panels are distinct visually.

Please generate the complete working code for this single-page dashboard.
